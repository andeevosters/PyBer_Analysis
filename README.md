# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
PyBer, a ride-sharing company, has asked us to provide further analysis to better understand the makeup of their business by city type––urban, suburban and rural. We were asked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, using Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. In this analysis, we'll summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used to make business decisions. 

## Results
